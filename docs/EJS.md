# External JS Scripts Setup Guide

To download from YouTube, yt-dlp needs to solve JavaScript challenges presented by YouTube using an external JavaScript runtime. 

This involves running challenge solver scripts maintained at [yt-dlp-ejs](https://github.com/yt-dlp/ejs). Depending on your yt-dlp installation method, you may need to set up and enable these components manually.

This guide will help you set up and enable the necessary components based on your yt-dlp installation method.

> [!NOTE]  
> EJS replaces the prior JSInterp and PhantomJS based approach. For YouTube both are no longer used. PhantomJS is still being used for a few other extractors, but is planned to be deprecated in the near future.

## Setup steps

1. [Install a supported JavaScript runtime](#step-1-install-a-supported-javascript-runtime)
2. [Install EJS challenge solver scripts](#step-2-install-ejs-challenge-solver-scripts)

## Step 1: Install a supported JavaScript Runtime

| JS Runtime                      | Summary                              |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| [Deno](#deno) (recommended)     | Enabled by default.                  |
| [Node](#node)                   | Enable with `--js-runtimes node`     |
| [Bun](#bun)                     | Enable with `--js-runtimes bun`      |
| [QuickJS](#quickjs--quickjs-ng) | Enable with `--js-runtimes quickjs`  |


### deno

> [!TIP]
> Recommended

https://deno.com

#### Installation instructions

Minimum supported version: `2.0.0`

Download from https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/ or from your package manager.

When grabbing deno manually from the [Github release assets](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/latest) you will need to download `deno` and not `denort`.

#### Enable

Deno is enabled by default. To supply an optional path, use `--js-runtimes deno:/path/to/deno`

#### Notes

- Code is run with restricted permissions (e.g, no file system or network access)
- Supports downloading EJS script dependencies from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (`--remote-components ejs:npm`).

---

### node

https://nodejs.org

#### Installation instructions

Minimum supported version: `20.0.0`

Download from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ or from your package manager.

#### Enable

Enable with `--js-runtimes node` or `--js-runtimes node:/path/to/node`.
 
It is recommended to add this to your [yt-dlp configuration file](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration) to avoid needing to pass it every time.

#### Notes

- Runs code with [*some* permissions restricted](https://nodejs.org/api/permissions.html).

---
### bun

https://bun.com

#### Installation instructions

Minimum supported version: `1.0.31`

Download from https://bun.com/docs/installation or from your package manager.

#### Enable

Enable with `--js-runtimes bun` or `--js-runtimes bun:/path/to/bun`.
 
It is recommended to add this to your [yt-dlp configuration file](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration) to avoid needing to pass it every time.


#### Notes

- No permission restrictions available. Scripts have full file system and network access.
- Supports downloading EJS script dependencies from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (`--remote-components ejs:npm`).
- No support for SOCKS proxies when downloading EJS script dependencies from npm.

---
### QuickJS / QuickJS-NG

https://bellard.org/quickjs/ / https://quickjs-ng.github.io/quickjs/

#### Installation instructions

Minimum supported QuickJS version: `2023-12-9`

All versions of QuickJS-NG are supported.

Download from https://bellard.org/quickjs/ / https://quickjs-ng.github.io/quickjs/installation or from your package manager.

#### Enable

Enable with `--js-runtimes quickjs` or `--js-runtimes quickjs:/path/to/qjs`.
 
It is recommended to add this to your [yt-dlp configuration file](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration) to avoid needing to pass it every time.


#### Notes

- QuickJS versions prior to `2025-4-26` are missing optimizations which can lead to execution times of several minutes.
- All QuickJS-NG versions are missing optimizations which can lead to execution times of several minutes.
- Both QuickJS and QuickJS-NG do not fully allow executing files from stdin, so yt-dlp will create temporary files for each EJS script execution. This can theoretically lead to time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities.


## Step 2: Install EJS challenge solver scripts

### Option 1: Install the yt-dlp-ejs python package

yt-dlp ships a companion package, `yt-dlp-ejs`, which contains all the EJS scripts.

If you installed yt-dlp using the PyPI package (e.g. with pip or pipx), install _and upgrade_ yt-dlp with the `default` dependency group:

i.e. `pip install -U "yt-dlp[default]"`

The default dependency group includes the `yt-dlp-ejs` package.

Refer to https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation#with-pip for more details.

Alternatively, if you only want to install the EJS package, you can install the `yt-dlp-ejs` package directly from PyPI. The version MUST match the version specified in yt-dlp's `pyproject.toml` for the version of yt-dlp you are using.

> [!WARNING]
> This library SHOULD be updated alongside yt-dlp to avoid running an outdated version. The version MUST be a supported version as per yt-dlp's pyproject.toml file. yt-dlp may bump the minimum version on updates without warning, and old versions will be ignored by yt-dlp.

### Option 2: Enable EJS script downloads from npm

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This option only works with Deno and Bun runtimes, which support downloading npm packages on-the-fly.

To enable this, supply `--remote-components ejs:npm` to yt-dlp. It is recommended to add this to your [yt-dlp configuration file](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration) to avoid needing to pass it every time and allow automatic updates.

### Option 3: Enable EJS script downloads from GitHub

yt-dlp can automatically download the EJS scripts directly from GitHub (https://github.com/yt-dlp/ejs).

To enable this, supply `--remote-components ejs:github` to yt-dlp. It is recommended to add this to your [yt-dlp configuration file](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration) to avoid needing to pass it every time and allow automatic updates.


> [!NOTE]
> This method may not work if GitHub and GitHub release assets are not accessible from your network. This includes if you are using yt-dlp with a IPv6 IP-only (e.g., `--force-ipv6`)

## Plugins

You can install alternatives to the built-in JS challenge solvers through plugins.

### Featured Plugins:
- [yt-dlp-apple-webkit-jsi](https://github.com/grqz/yt-dlp-apple-webkit-jsi) by [grqz](https://github.com/grqz)
  - Experimental Apple WebKit JS Challenge Provider plugin for yt-dlp. Should work on most Apple devices. *Maintained by a yt-dlp maintainer*

Check out the [yt-dlp-jsc-provider](https://github.com/topics/yt-dlp-jsc-provider) GitHub topic for more JSC Provider plugins.

For developers, refer to the [JSC Provider developer documentation](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube/jsc/README.md)
- **Please note: Currently only the base JavaScript Challenge Provider API is public. The API to hook into yt-dlp's EJS scripts is private at this time due to ongoing development with potential breaking changes; it may be made public in the future.**
